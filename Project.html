                used to emit modulated signals.<br>When somebody crosses the path of the IR beam falling on thee sensor, <br>the triggering 
                circuit activates to trigger the monostable multivibrator <br>.The output of the monostable advances

                <p class="projrctsubp">is one of the most crucial elements in the life of human beings<br>. In 
                    todayâ€™s world, air pollution is rising at an alarming rate <br>because of which there 
                    is climate change, and this has adverse consequences on everyone.<br> The air 
                    around us is getting polluted because of the release of poisonous gases by 
                    industries,<br> vehicle emissions which leads to an increase in the concentration of 
                    harmful gases and<br> particulate matter in the atmosphere. The emission of various 
                    toxic gases from industries and <br>vehicles is precarious for both the terrestrial 
                    organism, as well as marine life.<br> Health problems like stroke, heart diseases, 
                    lung cancer, respiratory diseases, etc<br> are arising due to poor air quality. Poor air 
                    quality poses a significant risk to children, <br>asthmatics, pregnant women, as well 
                    as elderly people</p>

                    <p class="projrctsubp">the design and implementation of an IoT based Air Quality Index <br>Monitoring 
                        System that we have intended to develop using ESP 32 <br>microcontroller. The 
                        setup is going to show the air quality in PPM,<br> temperature, and humidity with 
                        2

                        Platform,Thing Speak.<br> The dashboard of the platform is to be set to public so 
                        that everyone and anyone can keep <br>a track of the quality of air at the location 
                        where the system would be installed.<br> In this way, we can monitor it very easily

                        our environment by curbing the release of <br>harmful gases emitted by industries, 
                        vehicles, etc. We get to know about the quality of air on <br>a real-time basis and
